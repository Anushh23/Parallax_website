        </h2>
        <p>
            Season 1 is Fleabag's struggle to live with herself knowing who she is and what she's done. She is so riddled with guilt and self loathing, that she just thinks of herself as "Fleabag," rather than her real name. Even as she's trying to convince the viewer that she has this fun and witty life, she knows deep down that she's living a lie. <br>
            Season 2 is the Priest's story of deciding who he really wants to be, while trying to suppress his issues and temptations. Since we only see this story from Fleabag's point of view, he is known only as the "Priest," recognizing all of his positive traits while ignoring his struggles. If this story was told from the Priest's point of view, he might call himself Fleabag. <br>
            THIS IS A LOVE STORY.

        <p>
            What would you do for love? For a brilliant male bookstore manager who crosses paths with an aspiring female writer, this question is put to the test. A charming yet awkward crush becomes something even more sinister when the writer becomes the manager's obsession. Using social media and the internet, he uses every tool at his disposal to become close to her, even going so far as to remove any obstacle --including people -- that stands in his way of getting to her.

            TWO LAWYERS ONE DEGREE.<br>
            While running from a drug deal gone bad, brilliant young college-dropout Mike Ross slips into a job interview with one of New York City's best legal closers, Harvey Specter. Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after recognizing his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Although Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about the law; and while Harvey might seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.

        <p>
            For me- Gossip Girl was connecting a life that I will probably never have lol. Not all girls, but it’s obviously most girls’ dreams to live like a Blair Waldorf or Serena. It’s just fun to watch them dress and behave at social events. The endless shoes, shopping money, expensive food, etc. Being taken out on a date in a limo and marrying a freakin prince (even though that was horrible). It’s like watching your dreams and being able to connect with it. It is kind of a dumb show but a guilty pleasure for many. <br>
            XO-XO GOSSIP GIRL.

        <p>
            Based on the award-winning comic book series by Charles Forsman, `The End of the F...ing World' sees two 17-year-old outsiders, James and Alyssa, embark on a road trip to find Alyssa's estranged father, who left home when she was just a child. James, who's pretty convinced he's a psychopath, has decided it's time to graduate from killing animals to something bigger, and he's already got a target in mind. Alyssa, the embodiment of existential angst, feels like she doesn't fit in at her new school despite being quite popular. Together, they get caught up on a trail of violent events that grow increasingly more ominous as their quest progresses.

        <p>
            The word 'Lupin' might make you think of a million anime movies, and this French series literally uses thief character Arsène Lupin as a point of inspiration for its protagonist. Omar Sy plays Assane Diop, the son of a Senegalese immigrant who was wrongly imprisoned for theft, at the behest of his powerful employer. Decades after his father commits suicide, Assane plots revenge on the employer's family, using <b>'gentleman thief'</b>skills inspired by the Lupin character.

        <p>
            Dark blends a variety of genres and excels at every single one of them; seemingly beginning as some kind of murder mystery with the type of atmosphere and feel resemblant of a dark crime drama, it very quickly introduces sci fi to the mix and, on top of that, you will soon come to learn of the incredibly deep history and lore involved, this being of the extent and detail you would perhaps expect to find in high fantasy, however the themes here are both serious and grounded in reality, drawing on a lot of scientific theory as well as both historical and religious texts.

        </h2>
        <p>
            In Brooklyn, Marshall Eriksen, a terribly insecure, sissy but sweet law student, pops the question to his assertive girlfriend Lily Aldrin, in an inadvertently explosive way (with champagne). This makes their year long cahoot, Ted Mosby, anxious that he may be left all alone. His overbearing 'other best friend', Barney Stinson, forces Ted to play a 'pick-up' game in the bar where he has decided to hunt for Lebanese girls. To both their surprise, Ted actually meets a suitable girlfriend, TV reporter Robin. As soon as he sees her on TV, Ted rushes to her apartment (with five dogs) to declare his love - while the others wait in Bangladeshi Rajit's cab- which startles her.
